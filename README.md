#Multi Store Frontend

### üëâ ‚ùó‚ùó ATTENTION ‚ùó‚ùó

### The backend uses render.com, and the server goes to sleep after 15 minutes of user inactivity (no requests to the server). And when a new request comes in, the server restarts. But it takes 2-4 minutes.

### This repository contains a frontend application developed using React Typescript that uses its own [backend](https://github.com/GnatykOleg/multi-store-backend).

## Application Description:
